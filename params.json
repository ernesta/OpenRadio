The [Open Radio website](http://radijas.opendata.lt/) displays whatever is currently on air, while [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/m1plius) is used for storing historical data. Open Radio is created and maintained by [Ernesta Orlovaitė](http://ernes7a.lt) and [Aurimas Račas](http://aurimas.eu).\r\n\r\n##Code\r\n**Backend**\r\n\r\n+ _plus.php_ retrieves the currently playing song from M1+, fetches additional track information from Last.fm, and saves everything to a JSON file.\r\n+ _scrobbler.php_ submits new tracks to Last.fm.\r\n+ _classes_ defines several simple data structures (Album, Artist, Song, and Tag); _Last.php_ is used for preparing and sending requests to Last.fm.\r\n+ _constants.php_ is used for storing global constants, while _secrets.php_ contains Last.fm API_KEY, API_SECRET, and SESSION_KEY.\r\n\r\n**Frontend**\r\n\r\n+ _scripts.js_ periodically processes the JSON file and updates the webpage.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n+ Scrobbling to Last.fm is asynchronously performed by [Gearman](http://gearman.org/).\r\n+ JavaScript becomes much nicer when used with [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).\r\n+ The no-hassle frontend framework of choice: [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n**Ernesta Orlovaitė**\r\n\r\n+ [ernes7a.lt](http://ernes7a.lt)\r\n+ [@ernes7a](http://twitter.com/ernes7a)\r\n\r\n**Aurimas Račas**\r\n\r\n+ [aurimas.eu](http://aurimas.eu)\r\n+ [@Aurimas](http://twitter.com/Aurimas)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
